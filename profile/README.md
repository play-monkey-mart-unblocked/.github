## What Is Monkey Mart?

Created by TinyDobbins, Monkey Mart is a light-hearted, fast-paced simulation game where you play as an entrepreneurial monkey running a jungle-themed grocery store.

Starting with a simple banana stand, youâ€™ll slowly build your empireâ€”selling everything from milk and corn to bread, popcorn, and even chocolate. As you grow, you'll hire helpers, manage stock, and upgrade your store to meet the rising demands of your adorable animal customers.

Itâ€™s casual, itâ€™s funâ€”but it also packs a surprising amount of strategy and time management!
